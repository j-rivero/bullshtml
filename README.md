# Bullshtml - Bullseye HTML Coverage Report Generator #

This tool allows users of the Bullseye Code Coverage tool to convert their coverage report generated by Bullseye into an HTML report, showing coverage as well as fully annotated source code.

SimpliVity is NOT an official maintainer of this code base.  It appeared defunct in its old Google Code home, so we forked and produced some of our own updates internally, because we use this tool as part of our Bullseye build process.  We want to share this code back to the public, but if anybody out there is interested in creating an "officially maintained" fork of this code, we would be happy to send Pull Requests your way.
